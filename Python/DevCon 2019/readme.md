This project was presented at the 2019 Cerner Developers Conference by Harlen Hays and Morgan Fuller. We participated in the Kaggle Competition, Histopathologic Cancer Detection and shared our project with over 250 data scientists, analysts, and engineers within the Cerner community. The goal of the competition was to design and optimize an algorithim that could correctly predict if a histopathologic slide image contained metastatic cancer tissue. The participants were provided with over 250,000 images and their corrosponding cancer tissue label with the expectation that they would make predictions on 16,000 additional images.
